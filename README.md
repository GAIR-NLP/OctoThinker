This repository contains the code for OctoThinker project. 


## ðŸ”¥ News
[2025-04] ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We release our progress blog on [**Notion**](https://tinyurl.com/OctoThinker), together with the first version of OctoThinker models on [**HuggingFace**](https://huggingface.co/collections/GAIR/octothinker-68035e416813f9833a8060f3).

## ðŸ“– Introduction


## Usage
Currently, our repo contains 3 main parts:
- Pre-training code based on [Nanotron](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron)
- RL code based on [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl)
- Evaluation code which is refined from [DeepSeekMath](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-math) and [MegaMath](https://github.com/LLM360/MegaMath)

### Pre-training


### RL


### Evaluation


### Visualization
We also provide the visualization code for the pre-training and RL process. All visualizations are in [plot](./plot/) directory to ensure the reproducibility.


## Acknowledgements

For training framework and inference engine, we useÂ [**verl**](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and Â [**vLLM**](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). We thank huggingface **[open-r1 team](https://huggingface.co/open-r1)**, [**a-m-team**](https://huggingface.co/a-m-team), and also [**SimpleRL**](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/simpleRL-reason) Project, to open source their dataset and training recipes. In fact, we are deeply grateful to the entire openâ€‘source community for their tireless efforts in making our exploration possible.
